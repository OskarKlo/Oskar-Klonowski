        <h3><center>Overview</center></h3>
        <p><center>I was born in Poland. I have been travelling the world since I was born. I have visited over 50 countries before the age of 18. I consider myself to be a social, rational and extroverted person, which is crucial to becoming an innovative developer of this millennium. I strongly agree with the quote below, as I think that it is equally as important to be able to take a leadership position but also be a good follower. 
        </center><br><br><center>
            “Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen.”      –Winston Churchill
